This project will be a web-based application that is based off the mobile app, Goodreads. GoodReads allows you to find and share books with other users. It also gives users recommendations. TightReads will be doing similar to this where you will be able to get recommended books and share books with other users on TightReads. You will also be able to see what other users are reading if you follow them.
